<h1>data_cleaning</h1>

<h3>This is a simple program to automatically clean Excel files based on your needs.</h3>

<p>The program starts by analyzing the data to find possible outliers.
If anything suspicious is found, the user is asked how he/she wants to handle the outliers.

The user can decide how he/she wants to deal with empty cells :
<li>Deleting rows with empty cells.</li>
<li>Replacing empty (numerical) cells with the Mean, Median or Mode value.</li>

The user can also decide how he/she wants to deal with wrong format data, wrong data, and duplicates.

When the user is done, he/she can save the changes to a new Excel file and download it.</p>
