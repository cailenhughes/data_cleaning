# data_cleaning

### This is a simple program to automatically clean Excel files based on your needs.

Users can decide how they want to deal with empty cells :
- Deleting rows with empty cells.
- Replacing empty (numerical) cells with the Mean, Median or Mode value.

Users can also decide how they want to deal with wrong format data, wrong data, and duplicates.

When you are done with your cleaning, you can save your changes to a new Excel file and download it.
