<h1>data_cleaning</h1>
<br>
<h3>This is a simple program to help you clean .csv files.</h3>
<br>
<p>The program starts by analyzing the data to find possible outliers.
If anything suspicious is found, the user is asked how he/she wants to handle the outliers.</p>
<br>
<p>In the second part, the user can decide how he/she wants to deal with empty cells :</p>
<li>Deleting rows with empty cells.</li>
<li>Replacing empty (numerical) cells with the Mean, Median or Mode value.</li>
<br>
<p>Finally, the user can save his changes to a new .csv or .xlsx file and download it.</p>
