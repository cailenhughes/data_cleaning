<h1>data_cleaning</h1>
<br>
<h3>This is a simple program to automatically clean Excel files.</h3>
<br>
<p>The program starts by analyzing the data to find possible outliers.
If anything suspicious is found, the user is asked how he/she wants to handle the outliers.</p>
<br>
<p>The user can decide how he/she wants to deal with empty cells :</p>
<li>Deleting rows with empty cells.</li>
<li>Replacing empty (numerical) cells with the Mean, Median or Mode value.</li>
<br>
<p>The user can also decide how he/she wants to deal with wrong format data, wrong data, and duplicates.</p>
<br>
<p>When the user is done, he/she can save the changes to a new Excel file and download it.</p>
